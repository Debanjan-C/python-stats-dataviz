4. Download the dataset - https://ed-public-download.app.cloud.gov/downloads/CollegeScorecard_Raw_Data.zip (265MB Zip File)
5. Unzip the file into a folder (there are many files, one for each school year)
6. Import the 2017-2018 school year file "MERGED2017_18_PP.csv" and explore:   
    - how many colleges or rows?   
    - how many variables or columns?   
    - Look at the first 20 colleges   
    - look at the last 20 colleges
    - Look at a random sample of 20 colleges

    - STABBR
    - ZIP
    - ADM_RATE
    - UGDS

    - Look at a random sample of 20 colleges   
8. Download and read the data dictionary file - https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/assets/CollegeScorecardDataDictionary.xlsx
9. Find out the definition of the above 9 variables and document the definitions in the Jupyter Notebook so that the readers of your notebook
will know the meaning of these variables.
