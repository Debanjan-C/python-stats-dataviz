# Assignment 03
## The Problem:
Write a program that generates 100 random integers between 0 and 9. 
Print them in a 10 by 10 matrix neatly arranged with surrounding asterisks (*):
```
***********************
* 5 1 5 6 2 7 8 6 4 2 *
* 2 3 7 0 6 9 2 4 2 8 *
* 0 0 8 6 4 1 7 2 7 6 *
* 0 1 9 0 0 8 5 8 6 8 *
* 4 1 0 5 5 7 4 6 4 4 *
* 6 0 2 0 1 9 8 2 3 9 *
* 4 0 4 8 1 7 6 6 2 1 *
* 1 7 6 8 5 4 1 9 6 7 *
* 6 4 7 9 9 3 8 2 6 1 *
* 9 0 6 4 0 1 0 6 9 9 *
***********************
```
## The Requirements:
- You should program and test the solution in both:
    - Jupyter notebook file
    - Python script (.py)
- Upload both files to your GitHub repository
- submit the link of your GitHub repo to BB.

## Hints:
- You can use Python standard library random to generate one random number at a time or you can use NumPy random library to generate 100 random number altogether in one shot.
- You are likely to use nested loop - a loop within in another loop since you are dealing with a 10 x 10 matrix.
