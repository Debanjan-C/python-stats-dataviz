# Prep Notes for Tutorial Session
## My Pep talk
- Python is fundamental, You must master it before you can move on to more advanced topics such as ML, NLP, EDA, Visualization, and Big Data. 
- No short cut. Must work extra hard in a continuous and consistent way, day in and day out for a long period of time, months and years.
- If you fail data 690, you will have little chance to succeed in other courses. 
- We can't call ourself a Data Scientist, if we are not a hardcore Python programmer.
- Time is precious and no much tiime left to catch up if you are behind. 
- The most important quality in a students is the combination of curiosity and work ethics. You must have both to really call yourself a student. 
- I am here to help only if you have the inner drive to help yourself. 
## Python
- Collections
    - list is the most used collection. Make it your BFF
    - create a new empty list and use append() function to add elements
- for loops
- while loops
- if/elif/else
- try/catch
- Statistics vs statistics
- Population vs Sample
## Programming best practices
- Break down complext problem into small pieces or pphases (snippets, functions, modules)
- Make one piece work first - Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
- Incrementally add more capabilities. 
- Refine and restructure as you go (In Software Engineering, it is call "refactor"), always strive to simplify.
- "given two solutions, only the simpler one is correct."
