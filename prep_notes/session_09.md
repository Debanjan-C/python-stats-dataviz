## Prep note for session 09
### Individual Projects
- Many varieties of topics: 
    - Crime
    - Healthcare (COVID-19, insurance)
    - Finance (stock market)
    - Weather (climate changes)
    - Sport (Tennis)
    - Tourism
    - Agriculture (health of soil)
    
- Proposal quality varies

some of the proposals did not provide enougn details. Questions are too general and vague which lead to unspecified/undecided variable selections.

- Unit of analysis and number of observations

- Data sources Kaggle (many examples to learn from but please be unique about your own research and not copying from others)

- Difference between .md and .ipynb (Markdown file vs Jupyter Notebook)

### Install/uninstall/upgrade packages

### Fundamental Python + Advanced Libraries 
- You need both. Must practice fundamental Python and use it in your everyday data science work.
- The notion that I know how to use Pandas and I don't need to know Python is completely wrong. 

### Markdown and Documentation are more important than you can imagine
Please take it seriously. You are not computer hackers. You are data scientists.
