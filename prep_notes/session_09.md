## Prep note for session 09
### Individual Projects
- Many varieties of topics: 
    - Crime
    - Healthcare (COVID-19)
    - Finance (stock market)
    - Weather (climate changes)
    - Sport (Tennis)
    - and more
- Proposal quality varies

some of the proposals did not provide enougn details. Questions are too general and vague which lead to unspecified/undecided variable selections.

### Install/uninstall/upgrade packages

### Fundamental Python + Advanced Libraries 
- You need both. Must practice fundamental Python and use it in your everyday data science work.
- The notion that I know how to use Pandas and I don't need to know Python is completely wrong. 

### Markdown and Documentation are more important than you can imagine
Please take it seriously. You are not computer hackers. You are data scientists.
